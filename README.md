<!-- To work on the same GitHub repository from two different PCs simultaneously, you need to follow a few steps to ensure that changes are synchronized properly between the two machines. Here's a general workflow: -->


<!-- Setup on the First PC -->

<!-- git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git -->

<!-- git add . -->
<!-- git commit -m "Your commit message" -->
<!-- git push origin main  # or the appropriate branch -->



<!-- Setup on the Second PC -->

<!-- git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git -->

<!-- git config --global user.name "Your Name" -->
<!-- git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com" -->

<!-- git pull origin main  # or the appropriate branch -->


<!-- git add . -->
<!-- git commit -m "Your commit message" -->
<!-- git push origin main  # or the appropriate branch -->

<!-- git status -->
<!-- git log -->

# important to listen 24.8 - 11:50

# 25.4 - Click button to modify text or input new text

# 25.5 - text add with an element just like "comment to any post" using textarea

# 25.6 - different mouse and keyboard events. 08:49 - delete & delete like github - very important

# 25.7 - to stop event bubble - stopPropagation, only clicked element execution - stopImmediatePropagation 
# event bubble means first execute li > ul > section > body respectively according to "bubble.html" means;
# like bubble going upward


# ul>#item-$*6>lorem2
# ul>li*6>lorem2

# ul>li#item-$*6>lorem2
# ul#list-container>li.item*6>lorem3

# 25.8 - for(const item of items) find each item from items by looping, add, remove child/parent element, delegate - important watch regularly

# 25.9 - full module summary with 3 main topi from the module, Event capture - should watch frequently

# 25.10 - Different types of events, Event bubbleVScapture, Event delegation, JS Event loop - have to learn
